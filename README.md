# Initial Project Documents

Whenever starting a new project, there are certain documents that are a good
idea to include in the repository. The purpose of *this* repository is for me
to keep some boilerplate versions of these docs that I can quickly grab and
insert into new projects.

## `root`
The files here are the documents that should live in the root directory of each
repository. **Note: `LICENSE_TEMPLATE` is the license utilized in most of my
projects, it is *not* the license that applies to this repository!** 

## `docs`
For the moment, the only file that lives here is the `initial_design.md`
document. This is a questionnaire that I put together which I find helpful when
hashing out a design for a new project.
